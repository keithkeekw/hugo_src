I am trying...
- to work on the theme for this blog.
- to refresh my knowledge on Linux after a period of hiatus.
- to write as many scripts to automate my job as well as my life.
<br />  
Currently...
- configuring my vimrc file as I am started to learn about this powerful text editor.
- figuring out some `30-Days Challenge` for the year 2021.

This page is inspired by [David Winterbottom's Now Page](https://codeinthehole.com/now/), which will lead you down a rabbit hole of other “Now” pages.
