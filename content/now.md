Currently I am:
- Learning about tiling window manager especially [Awesome WM](https://awesomewm.org/)
- Still working on my [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)
- Getting use to all the key binding for Neovim/Vim. 
- Learning about [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) as well.
<br />
Situation on COVID-19 in Malaysia:
- the number of infection remains at 3 figures.

This page is inspired by [David Winterbottom's Now Page](https://codeinthehole.com/now/), which will lead you down a rabbit hole of other “Now” pages.
